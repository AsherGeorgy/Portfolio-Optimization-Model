# Portfolio Optimization App: Inherent Limitations and Legal Disclaimer

This document outlines the limitations and legal disclaimer for the Portfolio Optimization App, which helps users optimize financial portfolios using historical data and mathematical models. It highlights the app's assumptions, constraints, and risks, providing users with a clear understanding of its capabilities and legal terms.


## Inherent Limitations

This app provides a robust analysis and optimization framework for financial portfolios using historical data and mathematical models. However, it is essential to acknowledge the inherent limitations and assumptions:

1. **Reliance on Historical Data**: The app uses historical price data from Yahoo Finance, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Market conditions, macroeconomic factors, and company-specific events can significantly impact future performance.

2. **Model Assumptions**: The app is based on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which assumes normal distribution of returns, constant correlations between assets, and rational, risk-averse investorsâ€”assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios, especially during market volatility.

3. **Simplified Risk Metrics**: The app uses volatility as a measure of risk, but this does not account for tail risks, liquidity issues, or non-linear risks inherent in some assets.

4. **Asset Coverage and Benchmark Dependency**: Only assets with sufficient historical data are included, and performance evaluation depends on the chosen benchmark index, which must be relevant to the portfolio's composition for meaningful comparisons.

5. **No Transaction Costs or Real-World Considerations**: The app assumes ideal conditions without transaction costs, taxes, or fees, and it does not account for real-world factors like changes in the risk-free rate, market impact, or behavioral biases.
